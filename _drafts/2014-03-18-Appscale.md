# Getting started with AppEngine

I used this example project.
`git clone git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-angular-guestbook-java.git`

The basic documentation which this is based upon can also be found on https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-angular-guestbook-java.

## Local Development

- Make sure you have at least
  * Maven version 3.1.0: `mvn -version`
  * Java 7

If you are in the app directory, simply run: `mvn appengine:devserver` and you can reach the sample app on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Deploying on AppEngine

### Setting up AppEngine
- Login to [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com/)
- Create an account with a specific application name <AppName>

- In the file `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml` change the `<application>` value from `gae-angular-guestbook` to your chosen <AppName>.

- Run `mvn appengine:update`
  * Behind a proxy you need to pass the proxy parameters specifically since they seem to not been inherited:

    `mvn -DproxySet=true -Dhttp.proxyHost=localhost -Dhttp.proxyPort=3128 appengine:update`

    See my other post to setup a proxy forwarder {% post_url 2014-03-17-Using-Cntlm-to-bypass-your-corporate-proxy %}.

- Now see and behold the nice app at `http://<AppName>.appspot.com/`. Note that it may take some time to fire up the datastore.

## Deploying on AppScale


- Don't forget to add to IP(-range) of the machine to your no-proxy list to access it directly.
